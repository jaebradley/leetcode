# Problems

* [Array Partition I](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i/description/)
    * > Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
* [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/description/)
* [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)
    * > Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

* [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)
* [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/)
    * > Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
* [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
    * > Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
      > You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
